# Coding Sample for Policy Integrity Job Application 
This Jupyter notebook is the final project that I completed with a classmate for my Introduction to Machine Learning class. 
It explores a number of datasets that may be associated with political instability in the U.S. 
It uses Python for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, finding the best regressor to predict the instability index from various predictors,
finding the best dimensionality reduction for regression, and finding the best dimensionality reduction for unsupervised classification.
